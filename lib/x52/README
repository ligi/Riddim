This is the first release of the Linux library for the MFD and the
LEDs found on the SAITEK X52 ( and PRO ) HOTAS joystick. The informations needed
for accessing this nice device where kindly supplied by saitek.

The code is released under the LGPL. For more details please read the
COPYING file.

Compilation of this library requires the libusb http://www.linux-usb.org/

The library itself consists of the x52.c and the x52.h file.
Programs which want to use the library have to link "x52.o" and
the libusb. For more details please have a look at the Makefile
supplied with this package. The Makefile builds a test program
named x52test.

With the x52test program it is possible to test all the features
of the library:

x52test text 0 'First Line'
x52test text 1 'Second Line'
x52test text 2 'Third Line'
x52test bri 0 40
x52test bri 1 50
x52test led 1 1
x52test time 1 12 20
x52test date 7 10 17

If you have any questions regarding using this library and/or the x52 (pro)
please send an email to <eduard@hasenleithner.at>. I also welcome
any hints for improvements of this library.
