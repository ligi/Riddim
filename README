=Compile=
 $> make
 
=Run=
 $> ./riddim [configfile]

 if no configfile is given riddim is trying to load "/etc/riddim.conf". If that fails riddim is using default values ( not very usefull perhaps )

example socat usage:
 socat tcp-l:54321,reuseaddr,fork file:/dev/ttyUSB0,b57600,waitlock=/var/run/rfcomm0.lock
